1. Purpose

- `cplx.hxx`: Complex numbers. `std::complex` doesn't work with CUDA.

- `defs.hxx`: Various small but useful helper functions.

- `div.hxx`: Integer division functions that always round towards
  negative or posistive infinity.

- `dual.hxx`: Dual numbers
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_number>.

- `rational.hxx`: Rational numbers

- `simd.hxx`: SIMD vectors, based on NSIMD
  <https://github.com/agenium-scale/nsimd>.

- `vec.hxx`, `sum.hxx`, `mat.hxx`, `rten.hxx`, `ten3.hxx`: Small
  multi-dimensional vectors and tensors with various symmetries.

- `vect.hxx`: Small vectors, similar to `std::array`, but with support
  for arithmetic operations.
