\CarpetX\space provides a way of setting up standard boundary conditions and symmetry conditions (to be applied on grid boundaries) via parameter files. In this section, we will describe the available options.

\subsection{Boundary conditions}

Users can choose between the following boundary condition types:

\begin{enumerate}
    \texttt{"none"}\: Don't apply any boundary condition to the grid. This is the default value in all directions"
    \texttt{"dirichlet"}\: Dirichlet boundary conditions.
    \texttt{"linear extrapolation"}: Linearly extrapolate interior values to boundary values.
    \texttt{"neumann"}: Neumann boundary conditions.
    \texttt{"robin"}: Robin boundary conditions.
\end{enumerate}
