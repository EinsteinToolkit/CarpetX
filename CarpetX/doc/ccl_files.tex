\todo{Talk about new macros and new macro features. The text below is mostly ok, but needs to be adapted}

The macros \texttt{DECLARE\_CCTK\_ARGUMENTSX\_WaveToyX\_RHS}, \texttt{CCTK\_ARGUMENTS} and \texttt{DECLARE\_CCTK\_PARAMETERS} allow the thorn writer to access parameters and grid functions declared in the thorn's \texttt{.ccl} files. Note that \Cactus\space now supports the \texttt{DECLARE\_CCTK\_ARGUMENTSX\_FUNC\_NAME} macro, where \texttt{FUNC\_NAME} is the name of a grid function declared in the \texttt{schedule.ccl} file. These macros restrict the access of a function to it's schedule-declared grid functions. More importantly, it provides a variable called \texttt{grid} which can be used to access the functionalities of the \texttt{Loop} API.
