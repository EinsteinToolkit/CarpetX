## Overview

This package contains a set of tools to load and visualize the
contents of a set of [openPMD](http://www.openpmd.org/#/start) files
(typically, a timeseries).

The routines of `openPMD-viewer` can be used in two ways :

- Use the **Python API**, in order to write a script that loads the
  data and produces a set of pre-defined plots.

- Use the **interactive GUI inside the Jupyter Notebook**, in order to interactively
visualize the data.

## Usage

### Tutorials

The notebooks in the folder `tutorials/` demonstrate how to use both
the API and the interactive GUI. You can view these notebooks online
[here](https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-viewer/tree/dev/docs/source/tutorials).

Alternatively, you can even
[*run* our tutorials online](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/openPMD/openPMD-viewer/dev?filepath=docs/source/tutorials%2F)!

You can also download and run these notebooks on your local computer
(when viewing the notebooks with the above link, click on `Raw` to be able to
save them to your local computer). In order to run the notebook on
your local computer, please install `openPMD-viewer` first (see
below), as well as `wget` (`pip install wget`).

### Notebook quick-starter

If you wish to use the **interactive GUI**, the installation of
`openPMD-viewer` provides a convenient executable which automatically
**creates a new pre-filled notebook** and **opens it in a
browser**. To use this executable, simply type in a regular terminal:

`openPMD_notebook`

(This executable is installed by default, when installing `openPMD-viewer`.)

## Installation

### Installation on a local computer

#### Installation with conda

In order to install `openPMD-viewer` with `conda`, please install the [Anaconda
distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/), and then type
```
conda install -c conda-forge openpmd-viewer
```
If you are using JupyterLab, please also install the `jupyter-matplotlib`
extension (See installation instructions
[here](https://github.com/matplotlib/jupyter-matplotlib)).

#### Installation with pip

You can also install `openPMD-viewer` using `pip`
```
pip install openpmd-viewer
```
In addition, if you wish to use the interactive GUI, please type
```
pip install jupyter
```

### Installation on a remote scientific cluster

If you wish to install the `openPMD-viewer` on a remote scientific
cluster, please make sure that the packages `numpy`, `scipy` and `h5py`
are available in your environment. This is typically done by a set of
`module load` commands (e.g. `module load h5py`) -- please refer to
the documentation of your scientific cluster.

Then type
```
pip install openPMD-viewer --user
```

Note: The package `jupyter` is only required for the **interactive
GUI** and thus it does not need to be installed if you are only using
the **Python API**.  For [NERSC](http://www.nersc.gov/) users, access to Jupyter
notebooks is provided when logging to
[https://ipython.nersc.gov](https://ipython.nersc.gov).
