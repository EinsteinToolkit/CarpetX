The recommended way of performing interpolation is using the flesh interface for interpolation by calling \texttt{CCTK\_InterpGridArrays()}, as documented on Sec.~C1.7.4 of the \Cactus\space user guide and with detailed API description in Sec.~A149 of the \Cactus\space reference manual.

Internally, this functionality is implemented by the \texttt{DriverInterpolate} function. If users desire, they can call it directly instead of using \texttt{CCTK\_InterpGridArrays()}. In order to do so, users must add the following to their \texttt{interface.ccl} file
%
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  CCTK_INT FUNCTION DriverInterpolate(
    CCTK_POINTER_TO_CONST IN cctkGH,
    CCTK_INT IN N_dims,
    CCTK_INT IN local_interp_handle,
    CCTK_INT IN param_table_handle,
    CCTK_INT IN coord_system_handle,
    CCTK_INT IN N_interp_points,
    CCTK_INT IN interp_coords_type,
    CCTK_POINTER_TO_CONST ARRAY IN interp_coords,
    CCTK_INT IN N_input_arrays,
    CCTK_INT ARRAY IN input_array_indices,
    CCTK_INT IN N_output_arrays,
    CCTK_INT ARRAY IN output_array_types,
    CCTK_POINTER ARRAY IN output_arrays)
  REQUIRES FUNCTION DriverInterpolate
\end{lstlisting}

Note that \texttt{DriverInterpolate} and \texttt{CCTK\_InterpGridArrays()} receive exactly the same arguments (again, a complete description of these is given in Sec.~A149 of the \Cactus\space reference manual) but some arguments are unused by \CarpetX. These are \texttt{coord\_system\_handle}, \texttt{interp\_coords\_type\_code}, \texttt{output\_array\_type\_codes} and \texttt{interp\_handle}. Here's and example of a \texttt{DriverInterpolate} call where these ignored parameters are set to zero:

\begin{lstlisting}
  // DriverInterpolate arguments that aren't currently used
  CCTK_INT const coord_system_handle = 0;
  CCTK_INT const interp_coords_type_code = 0;
  CCTK_INT const output_array_type_codes[1] = {0};
  int interp_handle = 0;

  // We assume that the other (non-ignored) parameters exist
  // within the scope but are ommited from this snippet for clarity
  DriverInterpolate(
      cctkGH, N_dims, interp_handle, param_table_handle, coord_system_handle,
      npoints, interp_coords_type_code, interp_coords, nvars, (int const*const)varinds,
      nvars, output_array_type_codes, output_array);
\end{lstlisting}

Lastly, to control the order of the interpolation operators, users can set the \texttt{CarpetX::interpolation\_order} parameter, which defaults to 1 and must be greater than 0.
