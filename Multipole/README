Purpose of This Thorn
---------------------

The Multipole thorn performs spherical harmonic mode decomposition of
Cactus grid functions on coordinate spheres.  It can decompose
multiple grid functions with any spin-weight on multiple spheres.
This thorn uses the interpolator interface to access grid functions,
so works with mesh-refinement and multi-patch.

---------------
Required thorns
---------------

* An interpolator, e.g. AEILocalInterp

Related thorns
--------------

* WeylScal4 can be used to compute the Weyl scalars, which can then be
  decomposed into modes on coordinate spheres by Multipole.
